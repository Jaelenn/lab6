      <strong>Addendum:</strong> 
    This webpage features a volume calculator for a rectangular prism. The JavaScript code, 
    located in the 'script.js' file, facilitates the calculation by taking user-inputted values for length, width, and height. 
    The calculated volume is then displayed in the designated area. The implementation follows the Holy Grail layout, with a centered header, 
    left-aligned navigation,  a centered main content area containing the calculator, a right-aligned advertisement, and a footer. 
    The visual design is inspired by the Holy Grail design principles.
  
    In solving the problem, careful attention was paid to user input validation to ensure that only 
    valid positive numbers are accepted for the calculation. The result is displayed in a formatted manner with two decimal places.
    During development, the main challenge involved ensuring that the calculated volume was correctly displayed. 
    This was addressed by refining the JavaScript code to correctly update the content of the designated span element 
    ('volumeValue'). Additionally, proper validation was implemented to handle invalid inputs gracefully,
    providing clear error messages to the user.
    The webpage adheres to modern web design principles, providing a user-friendly interface for calculating 
    volumes of rectangular prisms while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and responsive layout.
